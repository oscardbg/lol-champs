## Info

The app was developed with the official information provided by the API [DDragon LOL](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ddragon.html), but because of specific restriction on the use of the API I downloaded all the files and images and use them locally. This app was developed as a personal project and has NO commercial use.
